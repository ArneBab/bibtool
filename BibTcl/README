This directory contains a PRE-ALPHA release of a BibTool-Tcl integration.  The
functionality of BibTool is made available  through a dynamic loadable library
to Tcl.

This module has been tested against Tcl 7.6 and Tcl 8.0.

These  files are included in  the distribution of  BibTool to get some kind of
feedback. If you try/port/improve it contact me please.  The implementation is
by far  not complete. Thus the  usual rules apply: incompatible  changes might
occur.



Since I  don't know  how to  figure  out  the  proper  ways to set   up things
automatically yet the installation is a little bit awkward (Also remember that
this is a pre-alpha release). I know how to do it on UNIX systems only. If you
know the procedure  for other systems  drop me a mail  such that I can improve
this description.


WINDOWS
=======

Tcl/Tk is said to be running under Windows and the portability of the files is
high. Thus it should be easy to create a dll and use the bibtool/Tcl extension
on windows. Drop me a mail if you have done it.


MACINTOSH
=========

Tcl/Tk is said  to be running  under Macintosh. Thus  it should be possible to
port the library to this architecture. Drop me a mail if you have done it.


UNIX
====

- Configure and compile bibtool in the parent directory (..).
  The object files must be present in this directory.

- Go to the directory BibTcl. This is the directory containing this file.

- Ensure that the command  tclsh is present on  your path. This tclsh needs to
  be not too old and it needs to be installed properly.

- Run
	./configure

  You need to give the  same arguments as  for the configuration of BibTool in
  the previous directory. Especially prefix and exec-prefix are required to be
  the same.

  This should produce the file Makefile in the current directory.

- On Solaris edit the Makefile and remove  '-z text'  from SHLIB_LD.

- Run
	make

  This should  produce  the shared library  and  a small  Tcl loader which  is
  independent of  the architecture.  In fact  it figures out  the architecture
  and uses the appropriate version which should be installed.

- Run
	make install

  This creates  a   subdirectory of LIBDIR  according  to  the OS  used.  This
  directory contains the  shared library as  well as the   loader script.  The
  loader script can be  freely copied to any other  place. The  shared library
  must stay in this  directory since the location is  compiled into the loader
  script.

- Run
	make clean

  to remove the intermediate files.


This procedure can  be repeated  for different  architectures which  share the
same installation directory.



DOCUMENTATION
=============

I have started to describe the Tcl interface  in the document bibtcl.ltx which
can be   found  in this     directory.   Consult this  document  for   further
descriptions.
