	BibTcl has been taken out of the default making since it has
	caused troubles on several machines.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="change">
	The printing of Strings honors now the dependencies that
	BibTeX relies on. This has been accomplished by a change in
	the printing routine for databases. No new resource is

	<code>print.entry.types</code> any more.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="add">
        The boolean resource <code>select.crossrefs</code> has been
        introduced. This resource can be used to force cross-referenced

 <!-- ===================================================================== -->
 <release version="2.46" date="February 12 2002">

 <!-- ===================================================================== -->
 <release version="2.44" date="April 7 1999">
  <action dev="gene" type="fix">
	Key generation fixed to expand BibTeX strings. The current
	behavior is likely to change again in a future release.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="update">
	Updated to work with kpathsea 3.1 (partially).
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="add">
	Searching for the kpathsea library is now the default in the
	configure script. Thus it is possible to simply place BibTool
	in a web2c tree. This only requires that the directory is
	named bibtool and bibtool is added to the filelists in
	Makefile, configure, and configure.in of the web2c main
	directory.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="fix">
	<code>check.double</code> message improved.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="fix">
	Initialization bug for kpathsea fixed.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="fix">
	Bugfix for cross referencing: normalization to lowercase was
	missing twice.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="fix">
	Bugfix in the TeX reading routines: spaces after active
	characters are not ignored. All characters are treated as
	unsigned. This seems to be preferable for extended ASCII
	characters.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="update">
	Key generation routines adapted to work with multiple
	databases. The symbol table is no longer abused to store
	information for the key generation. This may slow down the key
	generation a little bit. If it turns out to be a problem I
	will use a better algorithm.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="update">
	Minor modifications in makefiles.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="add">
	The configuration of BibTcl is now done automatically.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="add">
	New data type introduced: <code>Uchar</code> will hold UniCode
	characters in a future release. I just have to find regexp
	routines to work with UTF-8.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="update">
	Extraction extended to allow negation of the regular
	expression/string matching result. New resources
	<code>select.non</code> and <code>select.by.non.string</code>
	to specify such a request. C function
	<code>add_extract()</code> extended to cover negated values
	and the former function	<code>add_s_extract()</code>.
  </action>
 </release>

 <!-- ===================================================================== -->
 <release version="2.43" date="">
  <action dev="gene" type="add">
	Additional library <code>braces.rsc</code> to translate quotes
	as field delimiters into braces.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="update">
	<code>bibtool -h</code> reports now also the library path.
	This can be used by external scripts to find the installation
	directory of BibTool.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="fix">
	Bugfix: comments are no longer crippled.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="fix">
	Minor bugfix in rewriting code: empty pattern works again.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="fix">
	The regression tests have revealed a bugfix in the key
	generation code. I am not aware of the change that has let to
	this effect but the new behaviour is correct. Before, the
	macro expansion was suppressed under certain circumstances.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="add">
	BibTcl: <code>bibtool count db</code> added.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="fix">
	BibTcl fix: <code>bibtool missing</code> ignores the case of
	the field name.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="update">
	BibTcl: consistently renaming <code>record</code> to
	<code>entry</code>.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="fix">
	Minor modifications of makefile to correctly generate
	<code>libbib.a</code> and install the header files.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="update">
	Reorganization of the code; header files are now in their own
	directory. I don&apos;t have the appropriate information for
	some DOS compilers yet. Thus minor modifications in the
	makefile might be required.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="add">
	C function <code>entry_statistics()</code> removed. The
	functionality can be modeled with the new C function
	<code>db_count()</code>. This takes into account that several
	databases can be managed internally.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="update">
	C function <code>save_word()</code> renamed to
	<code>add_word()</code>. <code>list_words()</code> removed
	since it has been used for debugging only.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="update">
	EntryTypes implementation changed. The API doesn&apos;t
	change. Datatype <code>StringTab</code> is now local to
	<code>symbols.c</code>. Datatype <code>Rule</code> is now
	local to <code>rewrite.c</code>.
  </action>
 </release>

 <!-- ===================================================================== -->
 <release version="2.42" date="">
  <action dev="gene" type="add">
	New selection operation introduced. The selection with regular
	expressions is complemented by a selection according to simple
	substrings. This selection is initiated with the new resource
	<code>select.string</code> which takes the same arguments as
	the resource <code>select</code> but does comparison for a
	substring instead of regular expression matching. The value of
	<code>select.case.sensitive</code> is taken into account but
	at runtime and not at specification time. Certain characters
	can be ignored for the comparison. Those are contained in the
	new string resource <code>select.ignored</code>.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="add">
	New resource <code>print.entry.types</code> introduced. This
	resource controlls the entry types and the order in which they
	are printed. In fact the macro printing facility is obsolete
	with this new resource.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="add">
	New resource <code>clear.ignored.words</code> introduced. In
	fact this is a function which deletes all ignored words. Thus
	it is possible to determine all ignored words at runtime--even
	the compiled in defaults.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="fix">
	Bug fixed: selection honours the resource
	<code>print.all.strings</code> now.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="update">
	Makefiles slightly improved. Less manual adaption.
	Installation of all library files -- even on Solaris.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="fix">
	Name formatting omission fixed: Translation and length are
	taken into account correctly. The new name format sign * has
	been introduced to denote the inheritance of the translation
	from the calling format.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="update">
	Restriction relaxed. Now it is possible to declare up to
	MAXINT entry types and not only 4096. The <code>Record</code>
	data structure and the associated macros have been modified
	slightly to accomplish this.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="fix">
	Bug in the aux file selection mechanism fixed. This bug caused
	some cross referenced entries to be missing under special
	circumstances.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="fix">
	Bug in <code>key.c</code> fixed which caused a crash because
	an initialization was missing under certain circumstances.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="add">
	Make target <code>libbib.a</code> added. This is known to work
	on UNIX. I would like to get feedback for other systems.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="fix">
	Minor bug in <code>names.c</code> fixed.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="fix">
	Minor bug in <code>print.c</code> fixed.
	<code>print.wide.equal</code> does not have exceptions any
	more.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="fix">
	Minor bug in <code>print.c</code> fixed. Deleted fields are
	treated better.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="fix">
	Bug in <code>database.c</code> fixed which caused macro
	expansion to fail under certain circumstances.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="update">
	BibTcl: <code>bibtool format</code> allows to use the full
	power of format specifications.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="add">
	BibTcl: <code>bibtool sprint</code> added which returns the
	formatted string representation of an entry.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="fix">
	BibTcl: Bug in <code>$rec set \$key ...</code> fixed.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="update">
	Minor changes in the C interface (Just wait for the compiler
	or linker to complain about different arguments:-).
  </action>
 </release>

 <!-- ===================================================================== -->
 <release version="2.41" date="">
  <action dev="gene" type="add">
	New boolean resource <code>print.equal.right</code> which
	controls whether the = in normal entries is aligned right or
	left.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="add">
	New boolean <code>resource print.wide.equal</code> which
	controlls whether the equal sign is surrounded by spaces even
	if the alignment forces a narrower layout.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="add">
	New boolean resource <code>print.comma.at.end</code> which
	controlls whether the comma between fields is printed at the
	end or at the beginning of a field/value pair.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="add">
	New boolean resource <code>print.deleted.entries</code> which
	controls the treatment of deleted entries. If this resource is
	true then delete entries are put as comments into the output.
	This is the old behavior and thus it is the default.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="add">
	Pseudo field <code>sortkey</code> added.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="add">
	Pseudo field <code>source</code> added which contains the
	filename the record has been read from or the empty string if
	this can not be determined.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="fix">
	Makefile adapted to meet the description.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="add">
	configure creates <code>./config.h</code> aswell.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="add">
	Strings can be either local to a database or global. The
	output of macros does include local macros only. This is a
	point of incompatibility with previous versions.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="add">
	Massive extensions to BibTcl.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="doc">
	Cleaning of the sources and massive addition of documentation.
	Now the documentation of the C functions is present. Thus it
	becomes possible to use the BibTool routines to write C
	programs. BibTcl is a first application of this technique.
	Nevertheless a few changes seem possible before things are cut
	in stone.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="doc">
	According to a suggestion by Oren Patashnik the term entry is
	used instead of record -- at least in the documentation.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="fix">
	Minor bug in <code>print.c</code> fixed which caused looping
	when small values for line length and alignment column was
	given.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="fix">
	Minor bugfix in <code>key.c</code>. The resource
	<code>crossref.limit</code> was off by 1.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="add">
	Some additions have been made to support new features in the
	forthcoming BibTeX 1.0. They do not really work right now but
	just restrict the accepted input files.
  </action>
  <action dev="gene" type="add">
	Flag <code>--with-kpathsea</code> added to configure.

	Sorting uses the new key instead of the old one as before.
	This has not been specified, but the new behaviour might be
	more intuitive.

  <action dev="gene" type="fix">
	<code>key.format=empty</code> fixed. <code>key.format</code>

	Typo in documentation: I had typed <code>preserve.key</code>
	instead of <code>preserve.keys</code>. Shame on me:-) Some
	additional examples in the documentation.

  <action dev="gene" type="update">
	Field deletetion completely covered by the rewriting

 <!-- ===================================================================== -->
 <release version="2.39" date="">

	The default for the pattern in the select resource is now
	&quot;.&quot;. Thus it is easier to select entries with a
	given type.

  <action dev="gene" type="add">
	New resource <code>preserve.keys</code> introduced. If this

	Initially this resource is off.

	The disambiguation now respects the order of the entries.

	Formating names: Names connected by ~ or tight initials (A.U.
	Thor) are now treated better.

	specifier can be used to select another but the first number.
	E.g. %.2d means to use the second number.
